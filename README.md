# Merkle Tree & RSA Encryption
This is a Python implementation of a Merkle Tree and RSA encryption. The code includes a variety of functions for working with the Merkle Tree, including adding new leaf nodes, calculating the root of the tree, providing proof of inclusion for a specific leaf, and checking a given proof of inclusion. Additionally, the code includes functions for generating RSA key pairs, creating digital signatures using the private key, and verifying signatures using the public key.

## Merkle Tree
The Merkle Tree is built by recursively concatenating the SHA256 hashes of the left and right nodes and creating a new node with the resulting hash. This provides a secure and efficient way to prove the inclusion of a specific leaf node in the tree without revealing the contents of the other leaf nodes.

## Adding a new leaf
To add a new leaf to the tree, simply call the add_leaf() function and pass in the data for the new leaf as a string.

## Calculating the root of the tree
To calculate the root of the tree, call the calc_root() function. This will output the root value in hex.

## Providing proof of inclusion
To provide proof of inclusion for a specific leaf, call the generate_proof() function and pass in the leaf's unique identifier. This will return a list of hashes that can be used to prove that the leaf is a part of the tree.

## Checking a given proof of inclusion
To check a given proof of inclusion, call the check_proof() function and pass in the leaf's unique identifier and the proof list generated by the generate_proof() function. This will return a Boolean value indicating whether or not the proof is valid.

## RSA Encryption
The RSA encryption functions make use of the cryptography library to generate RSA key pairs, create digital signatures using the private key, and verify signatures using the public key. The key pair is serialized to be written to files.

## Generating a RSA key pair
To generate a new RSA key pair, call the generate_key_pair() function. This will output the public and private key in PEM format.

## Creating a signature
To create a signature using the private key, call the create_signature() function and pass in the data to be signed and the private key.

## Verifying a signature
To verify a signature, call the verify_signature() function and pass in the data, the signature, and the public key.

## Requirements
This code requires Python 3 and the cryptography library. You can install the cryptography library by running pip install cryptography.
